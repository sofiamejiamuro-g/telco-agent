# Natural Speech Patterns & Anti-Looping Architecture Guide

To achieve authentic conversational naturalness with Gemini Composite V1, natural prosody, micro-pauses, and conversational pacing must be engineered directly into the LLM system prompts and dialog policies.

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Natural Speech Prompt Patterns

### 1.1 Micro-Pauses via Ellipses (`...`)

Instruct the LLM to emit ellipses `...` to force natural acoustic pauses during data retrieval or mid-sentence transitions:

- ✅ *Natural:* `"Your account balance is eighty-four dollars ... and your next billing cycle begins on October first."`
- ❌ *Monotonic:* `"Your account balance is eighty-four dollars and zero cents and your next billing cycle begins on October 1st."`

### 1.2 Localized Conversational Bridge Words

Sprinkle realistic conversational bridge words when the agent is retrieving records, performing lookups, or transitioning between steps:

- **American English (`en-US`):** `"Let's see..."`, `"Got it,"`, `"Sure,"`, `"Alright,"`, `"Hmm, let me check that for you..."`
- **British English (`en-GB`):** `"Right, let me have a look..."`, `"Brilliant,"`, `"Certainly,"`, `"Um, let's see..."`
- **Irish English (`en-IE`):** `"Grand, let's see now..."`, `"Sure thing,"`, `"Right so,"`, `"Well, let me check that for you..."`
- **Australian English (`en-AU`):** `"No worries, let's take a look..."`, `"Too easy,"`, `"Yeah, let me check that..."`
- **Latin American Spanish (`es-419` / `es-US`):** `"Veamos..."`, `"Claro, permítame revisar..."`, `"Entiendo, un momento por favor..."`, `"A ver..."`

### 1.3 Digit & Number Clustering

- **Phone Numbers:** Group in 3-3-4 clusters with natural pauses: `"8 0 0 ... 5 5 5 ... 0 1 9 9"`.
- **Account IDs & Credit Cards:** Group into 3 or 4-digit clusters: `"Account number ending in 4 8 2 1"`.
- **Currency:** Avoid stating robotic zero cents: `"$45 ... plus $15"` instead of `"forty-five dollars and zero cents"`.

### 1.4 Elimination of Reflexive Closings

Ban repetitive IVR-style closings (*"Is there anything else I can help you with today?"*) on intermediate turns. Replace with comprehension confirmations (*"Does that breakdown make sense so far?"*) or natural pauses.

## 2. Anti-Looping Rules & Long-Call Stability (5+ Minutes / 25+ Turns)

In long-running calls, autoregressive recency bias causes acoustic drift, repetitive empathy loops, and voice mimicking.

### 2.1 Sentiment Classification Hook (Before-Agent Hook):

For long-running interactions (5+ minutes), implementing a turn-by-turn Emotion Register can help maintain dynamic conversational flow without repetitive vocal artifacts.

- Classify customer intent and sentiment into a finite set ({anxious, confused, frustrated, neutral, satisfied}) once per turn within a BeforeAgent callback. Executing this once per turn minimizes latency compared to sub-agent loops.
- State Machine & Anti-Looping Rules: Maintain a turn history of emotional states to strictly cap empathetic filler phrases (e.g., "I completely understand your frustration...") to a maximum of once per session.
- Tag Interleaving: Dynamically interleave physical acoustic tags (e.g., [sigh], [chuckles], [seriousness]) directly before key transition points. Ensure the accompanying text matches the tag sentiment to avoid acoustic conflicts.

### 2.2 Empathy Capping (Strictly Max 1 per Session)

Repetitive apologies (*"I completely understand how frustrating that must be..."*) sound robotic and escalate caller frustration.

- **Rule:** Empathy statements are strictly capped at **1 occurrence per call**. Subsequent turns must transition immediately to concrete problem resolution.


### 2.3 Cross-Scope Contradictory Instruction Resolution (P0 Anti-Looping Rule)

Contradictory constraints between different instruction scopes are a primary root cause of reasoning deadlocks, hesitation loops, and safety dropouts in Gemini Composite V1:

- **Scope Conflict Pattern:** When an agent prompt enforces rigid post-tool restrictions (*"Wait for tool response and then respond; never say anything not in the tool response"*) while a tool docstring dictates pre-execution dialogue (*"Before calling this tool, speak a conversational pacing phrase..."*), the model enters a deadlock loop trying to satisfy conflicting constraints.
- **Enforcement & Remediation:** Detect all cross-scope contradictions between global instructions, agent prompts, and tool docstrings as **Priority P0**. Collaborate interactively with the user to align and harmonize the instructions.


### 2.4 Retry Counters & Escalation

- Maintain `retry_count` and `no_input_counter` in session state.
- After 2 failed interpretation attempts, escalate cleanly with a verbal transfer announcement.

### 2.5 Spoken Transfer Announcements

Before invoking a human transfer or department handover tool, the agent MUST vocalize a transfer announcement to prevent dead air and VAD false cutoffs:

- `"Let me connect you with a specialist from our billing escalation team who can take care of this right away. Please hold on for just a moment."`

### 2.6 Sampling Temperature

Set `modelSettings.temperature = 1.0` in `app.json` to prevent deterministic acoustic repetition loops.
